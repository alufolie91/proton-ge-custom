Subject: [PATCH 011/341] amend! ntdll: HACK: Enable
 WINE_ALERT_SIMULATE_SCHED_QUANTUM option for other IdeaFactory games using
 Orochi 4

ntdll: HACK: Enable WINE_ALERT_SIMULATE_SCHED_QUANTUM option for more games.

There are other IdeaFactory games using Orochi 4.

This should help with massive frametime spikes problems in the following
games, since they share the same game engine as Mary Skelter 2:

- Mary Skelter Finale (2357400)
- Death end re;Quest (Application.exe) (990050)
- Death end re;Quest 2 (1266220)
- Megadimension Neptunia VIIR (774511)
- Neptunia Virtual Stars (1399840)
- Dragon Star Varnir (1062040)
