+      In order to make some window properties like position, size,
+      "always on top" or user defined rules for window behavior persistent, the
+      compositor needs some way to identify windows even after the application
+      has been restarted.
+      This protocol allows clients to make this possible by setting a tag for
+      toplevels.
+
+      Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing
+      phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the
+      corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can
+      only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.

+        it's preferable for it to be human readable, but it must be suitable
+        for configuration files and should not be translated.
+        Suitable tags would for example be "main window", "settings",
+        "e-mail composer" or similar.
+
+        The tag does not need to be unique across applications, and the client
+        may set the same tag for multiple windows, for example if the user has
+        opened the same UI twice. How the potentially resulting conflicts are
+        handled is compositor policy.
+
+        The client should set the tag as part of the initial commit on the
+        associated toplevel, but it may set it at any time afterwards as well,
+        for example if the purpose of the toplevel changes.
